The assignment completed here combined the test and training 
data sets of accelerometer readings from 32 subjects performing
6 activities. From there, the variables are cleaned by applying
more understandable names, the activities are given proper
readable names, and the data is summarized to the average
of each variable measure, grouped by subject and activity. This
was then saved to a text file called tidy_datset.txt

run_analysis.R is the raw script used for creating the tidy
data set.

run_analysis.md is a codebook that walks through the steps
behind the process.
